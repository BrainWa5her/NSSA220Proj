# NSSA220 Project
NSSA220 Packet Parser Project
This Project was Made for NSSA-220 with the purpose of Reading and Analyzing Metrics of pcap files

To Utilize, please download the 'PacketParser Master' Zip File, and extract everything to one folder.
From there, go into the 'Code' subfolder, and run pakcet_analyzer to get the filtered results of the sample pcap files found in the 'Captures' subfolder.
